# COVID-19 Economic Impact Analysis

# This notebook analyzes the economic impact of COVID-19 across various countries using data science techniques. We'll explore trends in key economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and poverty levels.

# Importing Libraries

library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(lubridate)  # For date handling
library(caret)      # For machine learning tools
library(corrplot)   # For correlation visualization

# These libraries provide essential tools for data analysis:
# - tidyverse: A collection of R packages for data science
# - lubridate: Simplifies working with dates and times
# - caret: Offers functions for training and plotting machine learning models
# - corrplot: Visualization of correlation matrices

# %%
# Loading the Dataset

# Load dataset from CSV file
df <- read.csv('covid_economic_impact.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(df)

# The dataset includes:
# - country: The country being analyzed
# - date: The date of the recorded data
# - gdp_growth: GDP growth rate during the pandemic
# - unemployment_rate: Unemployment rate during the pandemic
# - poverty_rate: Poverty rate changes due to economic conditions

# %%
# Data Preprocessing

# Convert date column to Date type
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

# Check for missing values
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(df))
print(missing_values)

# Remove rows with missing values
df <- na.omit(df)

# Data preprocessing ensures data quality:
# - Converting dates allows for time-based analysis
# - Handling missing values prevents skewed results and ensures model accuracy

# %%
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Plot GDP growth over time
ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = gdp_growth, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "GDP Growth Over Time by Country",
       x = "Date", y = "GDP Growth (%)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Visualization helps understand economic trends:
# - Line plots show how GDP growth changed over time for different countries
# - This allows for comparison of economic responses and recovery patterns

# %%
# Correlation Analysis

# Create correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(df[c("gdp_growth", "unemployment_rate", "poverty_rate")])

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", order = "hclust", 
         addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 0.7, tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)

# Correlation analysis reveals relationships between economic indicators:
# - Strong correlations can inform policy decisions
# - It highlights which areas may need more attention or intervention

# %%
# Training a Predictive Model

# Prepare data for modeling
X <- df[c("unemployment_rate", "poverty_rate")]
y <- df$gdp_growth

# Split data into training and testing sets
set.seed(42)
train_index <- createDataPartition(y, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
X_train <- X[train_index, ]
X_test <- X[-train_index, ]
y_train <- y[train_index]
y_test <- y[-train_index]

# Train linear regression model
model <- lm(y_train ~ ., data = X_train)

# Linear regression is used because:
# - It provides a straightforward way to model relationships between variables
# - Coefficients are easily interpretable, showing the impact of each feature on GDP growth

# %%
# Making Predictions

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred <- predict(model, newdata = X_test)

# %%
# Evaluating Model Performance

# Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse <- mean((y_test - y_pred)^2)

# Calculate R-squared (R²)
r2 <- 1 - sum((y_test - y_pred)^2) / sum((y_test - mean(y_test))^2)

cat("Mean Squared Error:", mse, "\n")
cat("R² Score:", r2, "\n")

# Model evaluation metrics:
# - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better fit.
# - R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from independent variables. Values closer to 1 suggest better predictive power.
